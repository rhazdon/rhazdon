## Djordje Atlialp (@rhazdon)

Hey ðŸ‘‹! My name is Djordje! You can pronounce it like "George". 

I am a software engineer from Germany with a focus on cloud-based digital products. My technical focus is on software development in the backend, DevOps and the design of system architectures. 

Professionally, however, I like to deal with the concepts of digital products, their ethical and social added value and the transfer of technical know-how. 

Feel free to contact me if you want to talk to me about projects from my GitHub account, about digital education, ethics in software engineering or just want to have a chat. :)
